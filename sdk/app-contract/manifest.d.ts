/**
 * shared/app-contract/manifest.ts — the shape of a v2 app's `manifest.json`,
 * as an author writes it.
 *
 * `server/composition/plugins/plugin-loader-v2.ts`'s `readManifest`
 * validates the runtime-readable manifest; App package admission additionally
 * requires valid card covers and validates the required identity image to generate its display copy. This type is not a
 * substitute for that validation and does not model every nested rule
 * `readManifest` enforces. Shared contribution types cover required data;
 * `APPS.md` documents additional value, path and file checks that only the
 * host can perform. This contract also captures the top-level shape the host checks
 * field-for-field, so a third-party author's own manifest gets real
 * autocomplete and a real compile error for a missing `id` or a
 * `manifestVersion` that is not `2`, without this package encoding the host's
 * entire validation surface.
 *
 * `PluginV2Manifest` (the loader's own richer, fully-checked return type)
 * `extends` this interface, narrowing `capabilities`/`network`/`contributes`
 * from "may be absent" to "always present, defaulted or nullable"; the runtime
 * replaces the author icon and contributes fields with runtime shapes that allow
 * installed legacy Apps without identity icons or card covers. See that
 * interface's own doc comment in `plugin-loader-v2.ts`.
