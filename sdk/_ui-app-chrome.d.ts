/**
 * app-chrome.ts — the App side of the current-view Chrome protocol.
 *
 * Three deliberately separate verbs, matching the host's own three:
 *   · `set(description)` replaces the description and returns the accepted
 *     revision (or rejects with a coded error).
 *   · `onAction(handler)` answers a host-driven chrome action. The handler only
 *     says handled/rejected; the SDK stamps the host's identity onto the reply,
 *     so the App echoes requestId / revision / generation / viewToken and never
 *     chooses them.
 *   · `registerScrollSource(element)` watches the App's own main scroll element
 *     and reports a boolean. It is not a description update: a scroll signal
 *     never clears or replaces chrome state.
 *
 * A write is only ever sent once the host has bound this document (an opaque
 * host-minted view token pushed with `APP_CHROME.BINDING`). That document
 * identity — the nonce, the token, the confirmed business identity and every
 * queued writer — is owned by the SDK's shared current-view binding
 * (`app-current-view.ts`), which Chrome consumes. Chrome reads the token it
 * must echo live from that binding, never from a value it captured itself.
